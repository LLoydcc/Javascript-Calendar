# Javascript-Calendar

![The Calendar](../master/images/calendar.PNG) ![The Calendar](../master/images/calendar2.PNG)

build a tiny javascript calendar. 

I'm trying to improve my javascript skills, this calendar was the perfect challenge for me to learn some 
new things in this section. 

feel free to use any content, the functionality is pretty basic but works well. 
Maybe I'll spend some time in the future to expand this little project. 

Enjoy!
